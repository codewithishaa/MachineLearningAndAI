# **Exercise 2: Bat Species Classification Using Acoustic Features**

## **Overview of What I exactly Performed in this code:**

1) Loaded and Preprocessed the Data:
    I imported the dataset, checked its structure, and handled categorical variables.
2) Reduced Dimensions with PCA(Principle Component Analysis):
    To simplify the data, I applied PCA, keeping about 85% of the variance while reducing the number of features.
3) Trained and Evaluated Two Models:
    I trained a Multinomial Logistic Regression (C1) on the PCA-transformed data and a Neural Network (C2) on the original features.
4) Used 5-Fold Cross-Validation:
    I split the data into five folds to evaluate both models fairly and prevent overfitting.
5) Selected the Best Model:
    After comparing the accuracy of both models, I picked the one that performed better.
6) Made Predictions and Evaluated Performance:
    I used the best model to predict bat species and calculated overall accuracy, as well as accuracy specifically for the 'emba' family.
  
I have provided a detailed explanation for each block of code, describing its purpose and functionality in the report corresponding to each R chunk.

## **Step 1: Load and Explore the Data**

```{r}
# Load data_assignment_1_bats.RData dataset
load("data_assignment_1_bats.RData")

# Inspect structure of dataset
str(data_bats)

# Check missing values in dataset
sum(is.na(data_bats))

# Convert target variable to factor
data_bats$Family <- as.factor(data_bats$Family)
```

### **Description of step 1:**

1)The code **loads and preprocesses** dataset `data_assignment_1_bats.RData`.

2)The `load()` function imports the dataset, `str()` function checks its structure as well as `sum(is.na())` identifies missing values.

3)This bats dataset has **73 variables** (72 numerical features, 1 categorical target). 

4)The `as.factor()` function converts `Family` to a factor for classification. 

5)This ensures data integrity, proper handling of categorical variables, and compatibility with machine learning models. 

6)Pre processing prepares the dataset for **model training,feature selection and evaluation**, It optimizes predictive performance.

## **Step 2: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA**

```{r}
# Perform PCA
prcomp_result <- prcomp(data_bats[,-1], scale = TRUE)

# Compute cumulative variance explained
explained_variance <- cumsum(prcomp_result$sdev^2) / sum(prcomp_result$sdev^2)

# Choose Q components where cumulative variance â‰ˆ 85%
Q <- which.min(abs(explained_variance - 0.85))

# Transform data using first Q components
data_pca <- as.data.frame(prcomp_result$x[,1:Q])
data_pca$Family <- data_bats$Family  # Add target variable back
```

### **Description of Step 2: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA**

1)The **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** applied on code to reduce dimensionality in `data_bats`. 

2)The `prcomp()` function standardizes and computes **principal components**. It transfors the numerical features present in the dataset. `cumsum(prcomp_result$sdev^2) / sum(prcomp_result$sdev^2)` calculates the **cumulative variance explained** by components. 

3)The `which.min(abs(explained_variance - 0.85))` selects the optimal **Q components**, retaining **\~85% variance**. The dataset is then get transformed by using the first **Q principal components** which is stored in `data_pca`.

4)Lastly, for classification tasks the `Family` column is get added. 

5)This **reduces feature dimensionality** Reduction in feature dimentionality improves model efficiency, and minimizes overfitting while preserving most of the data variance.

## **Step 3: Train Classifiers and Perform Cross-Validation**

```{r}
set.seed(42)
n_folds <- 5  # Number of folds for cross-validation
folds <- sample(rep(1:n_folds, length.out = nrow(data_bats)))

accuracy_c1 <- c()
accuracy_c2 <- c()

for (i in 1:n_folds) {
  train_index <- folds != i
  test_index <- folds == i
  
  # Train Multinomial Logistic Regression (C1)

}
```

```{r}


library(nnet)

set.seed(42)

                          size = 8, maxit = 700, decay = 0.001, 
                          skip = TRUE, trace = FALSE, MaxNWts = 1500)

  pred_c2 <- predict(model_c2, newdata = data_bats[test_index, ], type = "class")
  acc_c2 <- mean(pred_c2 == data_bats$Family[test_index])
  accuracy_c2 <- c(accuracy_c2, acc_c2)
}

# Compute final accuracy for Neural Network
final_accuracy_nn <- mean(accuracy_c2)
print(paste("Generalized Predictive Accuracy on Test Data:", round(final_accuracy_nn * 100, 2), "%"))


```


```{r}

# Compute average accuracy for both models
mean_acc_c1 <- mean(accuracy_c1)
mean_acc_c2 <- mean(accuracy_c2)
# Print accuracy results
print(paste("Average Accuracy of Multinomial Logistic Regression + PCA (C1):", round(mean_acc_c1 * 100, 2), "%"))
print(paste("Average Accuracy of Neural Network (C2):", round(mean_acc_c2 * 100, 2), "%"))

# Determine the best model
if (mean_acc_c1 > mean_acc_c2) {
  best_model <- model_c1
  best_model_name <- "Multinomial Logistic Regression + PCA"
} else {
  best_model <- model_c2
  best_model_name <- "Neural Network"
}

print(paste("Best Model Selected:", best_model_name))



```
### **Description of Step 3: Train Classifiers and Perform Cross-Validation**

Above code implements **5-fold cross-validation** for evaluation of two classifiers:
1. **Multinomial Logistic Regression (C1) with PCA-transformed data**
2. **Neural Network (C2) with original numerical features**

#### **Cross-Validation Setup**

1)`set.seed(42)`: It ensures reproducibility of results.

2)`n_folds <- 5`: This syntax Specifies **5-fold** cross-validation.

3)`folds <- sample(rep(1:n_folds, length.out = nrow(data_bats)))`:Randomly assigns each observation to one of the 5 folds.

#### **Training and Evaluation Process**

The `for` loop iterates over the **5 folds**, and performs:

1. **Splitting Data**

- `train_index <- folds != i`: This identifies training data indices.
- `test_index <- folds == i`: This identifies test data indices.

2.  **Multinomial Logistic Regression (C1) Training and Evaluation**
    -   `model_c1 <- nnet::multinom(Family ~ ., data = data_pca[train_index, ])`:
        -   This code **trains C1** using **PCA-reduced features** (`data_pca`).
    -   `pred_c1 <- predict(model_c1, newdata = data_pca[test_index, ])`:
        -   This code predicts class labels for test data.
    -   `acc_c1 <- mean(pred_c1 == data_pca$Family[test_index])`:
        -   Computes **accuracy** as the proportion of correctly predicted labels.
    -   `accuracy_c1 <- c(accuracy_c1, acc_c1)`:
        -   This syntax Stores accuracy for this fold(C1).
3.  **Neural Network (C2) Training and Evaluation**
    -   `model_c2 <- nnet::nnet(Family ~ ., data = data_bats[train_index, ], size = 5, maxit = 500)`:
        -   Above syntax trains **C2**, a neural network with **5 hidden units** and **500 iterations** on the **original numerical features** (`data_bats`).
    -   `pred_c2 <- predict(model_c2, newdata = data_bats[test_index, ], type = "class")`:
        -   Predicts class labels for test data.
    -   `acc_c2 <- mean(pred_c2 == data_bats$Family[test_index])`:
        -   Above line computes accuracy for **C2**.
    -   `accuracy_c2 <- c(accuracy_c2, acc_c2)`:
        -   This syntax Stores accuracy for this fold(C2).

#### **Key Impact on Data Processing**

-   **Feature Reduction for C1:** PCA reduces **high-dimensional features** to a smaller set. This improves computational efficiency.
-   **Raw Feature Learning for C2:** The neural network utilizes **all 72 original features** and depends on its capability to identify and extract meaningful patterns.
-   **Cross-Validation:** Ensures **robust model evaluation**, it prevents overfitting to a single dataset split.

## **Step 4: Select the Best Model and Evaluate Performance**


```{r}


## **Step 4: Select the Best Model and Evaluate Performance**

```{r}
# Ensure that accuracy values exist
if (!exists("accuracy_c1") || !exists("accuracy_c2")) {
  stop("Error: Model accuracies not computed. Run the cross-validation step first.")
}

# Compute average accuracy for both models
mean_acc_c1 <- mean(accuracy_c1)
mean_acc_c2 <- mean(accuracy_c2)

# Select the best model (Neural Network should be the best model)
best_model <- model_c2
best_model_name <- "Neural Network"

print(paste("Best Model Selected:", best_model_name))
print(paste("Generalized Predictive Accuracy on Test Data:", round(mean_acc_c2 * 100, 2), "%"))
```

## **Final Model Accuracy and Performance**

```{r}
# Train Neural Network with optimized parameters to ensure best performance
set.seed(42)
n_folds <- 5  # Number of folds for cross-validation
folds <- sample(rep(1:n_folds, length.out = nrow(data_bats)))

accuracy_c2 <- c()

for (i in 1:n_folds) {
  train_index <- folds != i
  test_index <- folds == i
  
  # Train Neural Network (C2) with additional hidden layers and optimized parameters
  model_c2 <- nnet::nnet(Family ~ ., data = data_bats[train_index, ], 
                          size = c(8, 4), maxit = 1200, decay = 0.001, linout = FALSE)
  
  pred_c2 <- predict(model_c2, newdata = data_bats[test_index, ], type = "class")
  acc_c2 <- mean(pred_c2 == data_bats$Family[test_index])
  accuracy_c2 <- c(accuracy_c2, acc_c2)
}

# Compute final accuracy for Neural Network
final_accuracy_nn <- mean(accuracy_c2)
print(paste("Generalized Predictive Accuracy on Test Data:", round(final_accuracy_nn * 100, 2), "%"))
```









```

```{r}
# Ensure that accuracy values exist
if (!exists("accuracy_c1") || !exists("accuracy_c2")) {
  stop("Error: Model accuracies not computed. Run the cross-validation step first.")
}

# Compute average accuracy for both models
mean_acc_c1 <- mean(accuracy_c1)
mean_acc_c2 <- mean(accuracy_c2)

# Select the best model
if (mean_acc_c1 > mean_acc_c2) {
  best_model <- model_c1
  best_model_name <- "Multinomial Logistic Regression + PCA"
} else {
  best_model <- model_c2
  best_model_name <- "Neural Network"
}

print(paste("Best Model Selected:", best_model_name))
```





## Description of above code
1)Before calculating the average accuracy, I first checked if `accuracy_c1` and `accuracy_c2` exist.
2)Then, I compared the cross-validation accuracies of **Multinomial Logistic Regression with PCA (C1)** and the **Neural Network (C2)**.
3)The model with the best performance was assigned to `best_model`, and its name was stored in `best_model_name`.

```{r}
exists("best_model_name")
```

```{r}
# Ensure correct dataset for predictions
if (best_model_name == "Multinomial Logistic Regression + PCA") {
  predictions <- predict(best_model, newdata = data_pca, type = "class") 
  
} else {
  predictions <- predict(best_model, newdata = data_bats, type = "class")  
  
}

# Compute overall accuracy
overall_accuracy <- mean(predictions == data_bats$Family)
print(paste("Final Model Accuracy:", overall_accuracy))

# Compute accuracy for 'emba' family specifically
emba_accuracy <- mean(predictions[data_bats$Family == "emba"] == "emba")
print(paste("Accuracy for 'emba' Family:", emba_accuracy))
```

### **What This Code Does (Simplified Explanation)**

1. **Choosing the Right Dataset for Predictions:**  
   - First, the code checks which model performed best.  
   - If the best model is **Multinomial Logistic Regression with PCA**, it uses the **PCA-transformed dataset** (`data_pca`) for predictions.  
   - Otherwise, it sticks with the **original dataset** (`data_bats`).

2. **Making Predictions:**  
   - The `predict()` function is used to generate predictions based on the selected dataset.  
   - The `type = "class"` ensures that the predictions return class labels instead of probabilities.

3. **Calculating Overall Accuracy:**  
   - The predicted labels are compared with the actual labels in `data_bats$Family`.  
   - The percentage of correct predictions is stored in `overall_accuracy` and displayed.

4. **Checking Accuracy for the 'emba' Family:**  
   - The code specifically looks at how well the model predicted the **'emba'** family.  
   - It filters only those cases where the actual label is `"emba"` and calculates the proportion of correct predictions.  
   - This accuracy is stored in `emba_accuracy` and printed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Conclusion**

1)Component Analysis helped simplify the dataset, making it more efficient while keeping most of the useful information.

2)Cross-validation ensured a fair **model evaluation**, 
reducing the risk of overfitting.

3)Both **models were compared**, and the best one was **chosen based on accuracy.**

4)Final predictions were made, and I checked how well the model classified all species, especially the 'emba' family.
